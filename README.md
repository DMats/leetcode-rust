# LeetCode Solutions written in Rust

A repository of my LeetCode solutions written in Rust.

## Setup

This repo is developed in VSCode using the `rust-analyzer` extension. Install
the rust-analyzer extension by entering this command at the command palette
`Ctrl+P`

```none
ext install rust-lang.rust
```

The workspace file `leetcode-rust.code-workspace` configures the `rust-analyzer`
extension to automatically download "nightly" toolchain and run `rustfmt` on
save, using the config options stored in `rustfmt.toml`.
